# Fred Plugins

This fork of Devious Plugins are plugins made for the Devious API (see info below) and are either plugins made by
me or were outdated plugins that I ported and updated.
I am currently working on maintaining an updated version of each of my plugins to support the Devious Client API (https://github.com/jbx5/devious-client)

**If a plugin is not originally by me it will not have "Fred" in the plugin name**

Current Plugin List:
=
### Public Plugins: (Free, with Source Code Open Sourced a.k.a plugins in this repository)
- **Fred Gauntlet** 
  - It's like Gauntlet Extended but includes auto features like auto-prayer/wep switching at Hunllef to make
    the Hunllef fight nothing but having to dodge tornados and tiles. Makes getting combat achievements a piece of cake.
  and more! (Note: This is NOT a full auto plugin, but does include some auto features)
  encounters using various events. Comes with debug option for easy set-up.

[//]: # (### Private Plugin: &#40;Paid, with lifetime access to Source Code/Compiled Plugin + updates&#41;
- **Lucid ToA** - All the benefits of ToA extended with tons of helper features added in:
  - Auto-prayers (All pray-able bosses have auto prayers\)
  - Auto-dodge (most dodge-able attacks have auto-dodge options\)
  - 1-click Crondis Water Container
  - Auto Zebak wave skip
  - Hotkey Yellow Keris Spec
  - and more! (Note: This is NOT a full auto plugin that will do the whole raid for you, more like "semi-auto" mega-spoon\)mega-spoon)
